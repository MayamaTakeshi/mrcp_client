# mrcp_client

This is an experimental Media Resource Control Protocol client that I'm writing in node.js for learning purposes.

You must have sox installed. Do:

```
  apt install sox
```
or
```
  yum install sox
```

Then you can use either:
```
  node speechsync_client.js
```
or
  node speechrecog_client.js
```
to send requests to an MRCPv2 server.
